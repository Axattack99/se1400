<h2>Competition</h2>
    <p>I've been looking at some other websites that are similar to mine. I was impressed by the sites that I did find and found them very interesting. Some of the sites included lots of stats and other statistics about some of the weapons, titans, and other gadgets in the game. I was only able to find one that was entirely based upon the lore of the game.</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>How I want my website to be different than the others?</h4></li>
        <p>I want to have my site be more of a passion website, having information like lore. While also putting things that might be my favorite things about the game. I just want to have it be more a hun for finding other avenues as well. Like recommending video and such that go over the lore.</p>
    <li><h4>How will your website be formatted different from others?</h4></li>
        <p>I plan to start off as more of an information page were I express my opinions. Then after doing more research about the lore and suck I will continue to update and patch it. This is more of a passion website to show off my opinions and less of a tool to get better at teh game.</p>
    <li><h4>What kind of features will your website have?</h4></li>
        <p>Unlike the competing sites that I looked at my site will have more than just written information. I want to provide other sources of information such as video essay and other types of information. I also would like to have a tab to allow other to comment on certain play-styles and class setups in the game. </p>
    <li><h4>What kinda of stuff will your website be about?</h4></li>
        <p>I am planning to start by explaining the Titanfall and Titanfall 2 lore as best possible. Making it as easy to understand to anyone, whether they have played teh game or not. Then connecting that lore to the newer game in the universe, Apex Legends because it features characters and weapons from the older games.</p>
