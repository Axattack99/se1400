<h2>Website summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>What content will the site contain?</h4></li>
        <p>My website will be a collection of differnet lore and story elements of the once popular video game TitanFall and TitanFall 2. I will suggest different sources of media to show off this once amazing game.</p>
        <li><h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site?</h4></li>
        <p>I will be using site and different channels that are deicated to lore and story content that I find the most interesting. I will also include some different sources for playing and other games that I find similar to Titanfall.</p>
        <li><h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4></li>
        <p>Titanfall has been near and dear to my heart ever since I played it when I was younger. It had the most game changing and defining mechanics that set the standard for futuristic movement. I just want to remind or introduce this marvel of a game to people .</p>
        <li><h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4></li>
        <p>The game has not had very much recognition since its last game in 2016. There is a game called Apex Legends which is a battle royale style game. It builds off of the foundations of Titanfall by using different weapons and aspects from the games.</p>
        <li><h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4></li>
        <p>To explore and remember what, in my opinion, was one of the greatest games of all time. Even just to come and find videos or other resources to just help the time go by. This game has been a big part of my life and I would just like to share it with everyone else.</p>
        <li><h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4></li>
        <p>The goal for this site is to be able to share an intrest that I have with the rest of the community to bond over. Titanfall has been a large chunk of my life which has shaped my taste in game ever since. But mostly to share my passion with everyone who loves these games just as much as me.</p>
