<h2>Competition</h2>
    <p>I've been looking at some other websites that are similar to mine. I was impressed by the sites that I did find and found them very interesting. Some of the sites included lots of stats and other statistics about some of the weapons, titans, and other gadgets in the game. I was only able to find one that was entirely based upon the lore of the game.</p>
