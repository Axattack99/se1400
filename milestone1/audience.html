<h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>The goal of this website is ultimately just to show and share my passion with others. Whether that is people who also love the game and haven't heard about it in a while, or just people who stumbled upon the website to pass the time on something they found. I want to make the lore about this masterpiece of a game as easy and enjoyable to understand as possible.</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Who will my website be catered to?</h4>
        <p>My website is catered to anyone one who likes Titanfall or the style of video games in general. I want to make this website as accessable and fun to use as possible. To all levels of knowledge about titanfall and the newer titles as well.</p>
    </li>
        <li><h4>What is the age of your audience?</h4>
        <p>My audience would have an age range of about 18-30+ . This is because the game was rated M for a mature audience which means it was intended for an older demigraphic. I was playing it a a young age but I really dont have a defined age range. Anyone who would like to learn about stuff is free to. </p>
    </li>
        <li><h4>What is the gender of your audience?</h4>
    <p>Male would be the standard demigraphic for anything video game related. But as of late video games have been more inclusive of all genders and ages. The digital age has started to introduce electronics to kids of all genders and ages at a young age. The video game community has expenetually grown as of late. </p>
