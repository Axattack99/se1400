        <h3>For this page I will be going over a brief history of the past and future of Titanfall lore across the universe ranging from Titanfall 1 to the most current additon to the universe, Apex Legends. I love the story of the Titanfall 2 the most becasue it was the game I personally played and grew up with the most. It has a rich cast of characters and one of the most iconic endings in history. The emotion that is conveyed through the game is just a small part as to why this game is an utter masterpiece. </h3>

    <div class="div5"><h3 class="blk_bor">In the Titanfall universe, elite pilots use advanced combat mechs called Titans—giant exosuits with different abilities and personalities powered by advanced AI. The story follows Rifleman Jack Cooper, a Militia soldier unexpectedly thrust into the role of a Pilot when his mentor is killed during a mission. Cooper forms a bond with BT-7274 (BT), a Vanguard-class Titan equipped with adaptable AI. Together, they uncover and attempt to stop the IMC’s secret superweapon, the Fold Weapon, which can warp space-time and annihilate entire planets. As Cooper and BT fight through IMC forces and mercenary groups, the story focuses on the themes of trust, partnership, sacrifice, and the human–machine bond. Their mission ultimately determines the fate of the Frontier.</h3></div>
