        <h3>For this page I will be going over a brief history of the past and future of Titanfall lore across the universe ranging from Titanfall 1 to the most current additon to the universe, Apex Legends. I love the story of the Titanfall 2 the most becasue it was the game I personally played and grew up with the most. It has a rich cast of characters and one of the most iconic endings in history. The emotion that is conveyed through the game is just a small part as to why this game is an utter masterpiece. </h3>

    <div class="div5"><h3 class="blk_bor">In the Titanfall universe, elite pilots use advanced combat mechs called Titans—giant exosuits with different abilities and personalities powered by advanced AI. The story follows Rifleman Jack Cooper, a Militia soldier unexpectedly thrust into the role of a Pilot when his mentor is killed during a mission. Cooper forms a bond with BT-7274 (BT), a Vanguard-class Titan equipped with adaptable AI. Together, they uncover and attempt to stop the IMC’s secret superweapon, the Fold Weapon, which can warp space-time and annihilate entire planets. As Cooper and BT fight through IMC forces and mercenary groups, the story focuses on the themes of trust, partnership, sacrifice, and the human–machine bond. Their mission ultimately determines the fate of the Frontier.</h3></div>

        <div id="Ash"></div>
        <h2 class="blk_bor">Ash is a important part of the campaign and the future of the Titanfall universe as a whole. She is a mini-boss in the campaign that is a android with the mind of a scientist turned into a IMC elite pilot. In the campaign you end up needing to defeat her which you then do resulting in her "death". We later learn through the game Apex Legends that she was not fully killed like we had earlier thought. She appears as a playable character further intertwining the Titanfall and Apex universe. This can also be seen in the weapons that are in Apex as well with multiple weapons coming from Titanfall. This is also the case for another character in the IMC cast.</h2>
        <h2 class="para2">The other character that is shown below is named Viper, another IMC elite pilot that is tasked with fighting and defeating Jeck Cooper and BT. The character shown fater is his daughter, Valkyrie. Now this is a character that can allow for more story development when it comes to the mash between Titanfall and Apex. Being the daughter of a Viper she takes on some of his attributes of her father with the ability to fly and shoot missiles. Even having a skin in game honoring Viper with a similar paint job. She also has some references to Vipers dialog from Titanfall 2, giving people who did play Titanfall a little gift. There have always been influence in most characters in Apex but these two are the connect the two titles best. </h2>
