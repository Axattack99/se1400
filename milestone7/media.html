        <h3>This page is were I will collect videos, websites, and other forms of media that I believe do justice explaining the game and its effects on future games. Things like video essays and different lore explanation video that I feel do the best at introducing the game to those new to the genre or title. For me personally, I found the game through my father who played Titanfall 1 when I was younger. I mainly played Titanfall 2 because it was the more recent of the games when I was growimg up.</h3>

    <div class="div5"><h3 class="blk_bor">This page is one of the more work in progress pages since I would need to work on obtaining and looking through different resources that I find most relevent and easy to understand. I plan on adding more sources in the future when I have done some proper searching. </h3></div>

    <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px; border: none;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5iCZtJSCqcE" title="The Beauty of Titanfall 2: BT&#39;s Hidden Complexity" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <h2 class="blk_bor">Now this video I enjoy so much. It doesn't really go through the campaign in a amazing amount of depth, but instead goes into detail about one of the most amazing character building in video games to date. BT is one of my most favorite video game characters of all time, the story is as much a heroic story as much as it story of the bond between man and machine. This game being a multiplay driven game and having such an amazing campaign stands as a testimate to the overall quality of this game.</h2>
    <h2 class="blk_bor">I know that this video is pretty silly to start but it does a really good job at explaining the game in a easy and enjoyable way. Well enough to understand the lore while also going a good bit in depth.</h2>
    <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px; border: none;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zMEQOlIu3KA" title="TITANFALL 2 ... For Noobs" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <h2 class="para2">These videos do an amazing job at highlighting all of the different aspects that have made Titanfall 2 such an amazing and poorly utilized game. With the release of a much more advertized title by the same game studio over shadowing one of the greatest games of all time. Looking back at the quality of this game and how it compares to recent titles especially in the category of campaigns. This game had a offered a variety of gameplay mechanics to make the game fun and interesting compated to other FPS games.</h2>
    <h2 class="blk_bor">I was originally going to add these to their own seperate pages, but found it better off to use this page to show off other people opinions and takes on the game. There are many more videos taht I could have included to this page but then the page would be a mile long. But I can assure you that a common theme throughout all of the resources that I have searched is the appreciation that people have for the campaign. Even those who had never played until recently claim it to be one amoung the cult classics like Halo 3, Modern Warfare, and Bio-Shock.</h2>
