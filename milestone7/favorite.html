        <h3>In this page I will be going over some of my favorite parts of the game and my personal favorite items in the game as well. Mainly refering to the weapons, titans, and pilot classes that you cna play as. Everyone has their own playstyle which is possible through the multitude of classes and abilities in the game. </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="div5"><h3 class="blk_bor">Titanfall has an area of differnt classes to pick from, for both your pilot and your titan. They have a roster of 7 different titans that have different ability sets that make gameplay unquie. Aswell as cosmetics that adds another layer of customization. On the pilot side we have 7 different classes with different abilites and gadgets. Not to mention the multitude of weapons for you to mix and match. </h3></div>
    <div class="div6">
        <h2 class="blk_bor">When I was a frequent player of the game I used to lean more toward all of the movement classes when I went to pick my pilot. My person favorite was the Grappler class because it allowed to a quick and easy way to traverse the map. </h2>

        <h2 class="blk_bor">For my next Favorite thing is the Tone Titan, which is one of my most used and favorite Titans in the game. It is a class that has a semi-automatic rifle a frontal deplyable sheild, a ping launcher, and a rocket launcher. Along with a core ability that is a rocket salvo, I like this titan casue it can compete at close range but can also excel and long range.</h2>

        <h2 class="para2">Lastly is my favorite weapon in the whole game, the Alternator. It is a compact twin barrel smg that is fast and reliable and short to mid range. It excels with classes with movement abilites. </h2>
